## Getting Started

After cloning your forked repo, install needed dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You should see `HELLO WORLD`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## Project Structure
Your starting point, and the page you'll be building is `pages/index.js`. When you're done, this should look exactly like the Figma design file provided.

### Directories
- [src/components](src/components) - This is where you should put code for any React components you create. Import them into `pages/index.js` to use them.
- [public/images](public/images) - This is where you should put any image assets you'll use (you can export any images you need from Figma and put them here to use)
- [src/theme](src/theme) - If you choose to edit or add to the global Material UI theme, this is where you'll do that. Specifically, `src/theme/index.js` is your starting point for this.
